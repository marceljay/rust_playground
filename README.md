# Marcel's Rust Playground
Here I just want to try out some things as I learn Rust

Code is in various files in `/src`

I'm learning from various sources such as the Rust book and helpful Youtube videos:

- [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
= [Doug Milford, Lifetimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QoT9fmPYr8)

## Run code
`cargo run`

The code should generally run without errors, as I out-comment faulty code.
